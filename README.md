# PkgDecrypt
Decrypts and extracts PS Vita PKG files.

# Dependencies
* zlib

# Features
* 1:1 file extraction,
* Support for klicensee and zRIF keys for work.bin 1:1 recreation,
* Can either extract PKG or decrypt it into PKGS file,
* Different output hierarchies can be chosen for easy transfer to VITA.

# Usage
```
pkg_dec [--make-dirs=id|ux] [--license=<key>] [--raw] filename.pkg [output_directory]
	--make-dirs=id|ux	Use output directory to create special hierarchy,
				id	places all output in the <CONTENTID> folder
				ux	places all output in ux0-style hierarchy
	--license=<key>		Provide key to use as base for work.bin (*.rif) file creation.
				Two formats accepted - klicensee key (deprecated) and zRIF (recommended)
				zRIF could be made by NoNpDrm fake RIFs using make_key
	--raw			Output fully decrypted PKG instead of unpacking it, exclusive
	--split			Redirect output to another directory if there is no place in current
	<filename.pkg>		Input PKG file
	<output_directory>	Directory where all files will be places. Current directory by default.
```
To create new, zRIF license, use the make_key.

```
        make_key license_file
```


# Requirements
* Windows x64 or x86 (for precompiled builds) or other supported OS,
* VC++ Redist 2017 installed (not needed if using CMake),
* a)Vita with 3.60 henkaku, PKG file and license key[klicensee(deprecated) or zRIF(recommended)] for Vita installation,
* b)PKG file for extraction purposes only.

# Compile

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
sudo make install # For Linux and Mac
```

### 1.1.1.0
* Bug fixes.
### 1.1.0.0
New features:
- Support of generating fake RIFs from hex-encoded klicensee and zRIFs
- Unpacking files using ux0 hierarchy emulation
- Automatic recognition of DLC and GD packages (using pkg_info fields)
- make_key program to pack fake RIFs into zRIF format

Major refactoring of code:
- Split code over few modules, for example, key encoding and decoding done using keyflate.c
- Few utility functions (mkdirs and set of pkg_* functions mirroring stdio with transparent decryption)
- Improved code readability with structs defining various structures in pkg file

Bugfixes:
- Generated head.bin now have proper file size,
- Attempted to fix sku_flag value using drm_type of package (different solution from temp.bin),
- Other bugfixes.
### 1.0.0.3
* Added full support for license keys, now if you use license key it will generate fully working work.bin file,
* Added check for license, if license is not used, file work.bin will not be generated at all,
* All *.bin files are now generated in proper location `output_folder/sce_sys/packages/*.bin`
### 1.0.0.2
* Fixed Windows extraction, now it extract 1:1 files.
### 1.0.0.1
* St4rk's support for *.bin files
### 1.0.0.0
* St4rk Initial code

# ToDo list:
* Found out exactly how body.bin and stat.bin created.
* Add minGW build support
